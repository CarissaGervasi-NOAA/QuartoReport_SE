::: {#quarto-margin-sidebar .sidebar .margin-sidebar}

I want this in the sidebar on the margin.

This should be in the center? I think the problem is maybe that the margin sidebar is defined in page-layout-article and does not exist in page-layout-custom? Or maybe I am completely on the wrong track.
