<!-- Key bit is the fig-xyz label so that auto-numbering of fig works.
     Notice that this plot will work for panels between 1 and 20 or so.
     I am not customizing the paneling. -->

```{r fig-salmon, fig.cap="Plot of the data", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(salmon, aes(x=YEAR, y=log(NUMBER_OF_SPAWNERS))) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~COMMON_POPULATION_NAME)
